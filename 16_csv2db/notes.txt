Notes
- The 'discobandit.db' file stores the information used by sqlite and persists between executions
    - File will be created if it doesn't exist on attempting to connect
    - Use `sqlite3 discobandit.db` to activate sqlite using that database file
- Trying to create a table that already exists causes an error
    - Solved by dropping each table beforehand if it exists before creating it again
