k33 -- reflection and retrospection
2022-02-27

- I think my gut reaction is definitely against this line of reasoning and desire to disconnect
    - Not exactly luddite or "anti-technology" but similar
    - Maybe it also comes from my parents' repeated rhetoric around phone use that I now have a knee-jerk reaction to it
    - Personally, not sure if I want to do it, but considering, especially during school nights or times I need to focus
- I do think it has value to think back about how we use the internet
- Saw a comment about how when people see the negative sides of the internet, they often mean social media
    - For me at least this is definitely true, and endless scrolling is an issue
    - Comes with a lot of stress and delegates away a lot of attention
