K15: Cookie and Sessions Introduction
2021-10-19

Notes
- Need to specify the route accepts a 'POST' method before it can be used
    - place in the `@app.route('/route_name', methods=['GET', 'POST'])`
- Need to check if a session key exists before accessing it, otherwise a crash might happen if it isn't there
    - done with `session.get('key')`
