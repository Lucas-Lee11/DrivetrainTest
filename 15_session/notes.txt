K15: Cookie and Sessions Introduction
2021-10-19

Notes
- Need to specify the route accepts a 'POST' method before it can be used
    - place in the `@app.route('/route_name', methods=['GET', 'POST'])`
- When doing a post request with a form, use `request.form` instead of `request.args` in order to access the form information
- Need to check if a session key exists before accessing it, otherwise a crash might happen if it isn't there
    - done with `session.get('key')`
- Use `redirect()` method in order to redirect the user to an appropriate page, perhaps if they are not meant to be there
    - can use the `url_for()` method as well in order to get the correct url for some route method
