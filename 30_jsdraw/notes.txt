- Need to use `ctx.beginPath()` to pick up the pen and ensure shapes aren't connected
- After defining a canvas arc, need to use `ctx.fill()` to fill the arc
- The function linked by `addEventListener` is passed the event as a parameter when called
    - Can access the mouse location if it is a MouseEvent that triggered the function
